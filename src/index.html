<h2>TIPS: DON'T LET SPAIN TURN TO PAIN</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Use Taxis for the Airport: Taxi Drivers in the Madrid area have a flat fee of €30 to and from
		the airport. Ubers, Cabify, and Bolt might be more expensive otherwise.</li>
	<li>Brush up on essential Spanish phrases: You’ll probably take a Taxi, speak to a barista, or need
		to ask for directions. While Madrid is a very international city, brushing up on your Spanish will
		only make you feel more prepared.</li>
	<li>Keep your friends close and your purse closer: Crowded areas are a target spot for pickpockets.
		Beware of distractions and leaving your bags unattended. Use a bag that's hard to pry open.</li>
	<li>Read the Dress Code: Some popular tourist clubs are notorious for denying entry to those not
		strictly following the dress code. Don’t cut your night short and stay informed about the club’s
		expectations.</li>
	<li>Not all ham is created equal: Many places in tourist areas will try to upcharge you on their ham
		prices. While Madrid has a Jamon heavy culture, it’s worth knowing what the actual market value is
		for good quality ham. Also, don’t get scammed by getting Paella in Madrid. Paella is more prevalent
		in the coastal regions of Spain. Madrid is all about the Tortilla Española and Cocido Madrileño.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FROM DICTATORSHIP TO DISCOS</h2>
<p> Madrid's history unfolds as a tale of resilience and transformation. Emerging from the shadow of
	Franco's dictatorship, the city embraced democracy and experienced a cultural renaissance, with
	its streets becoming a canvas for artistic expression. Amidst the fervor of newfound freedom,
	Madrid's nightlife exploded, with legendary discotecas like Joy Eslava and Kapital drawing revelers
	into the early hours, shaping the city's reputation as a vibrant hub of entertainment and nocturnal adventure.</p>

I kept resubmitting on gradescope because I got error messages pertaining to this last section. I wanted to
simply put a one sentence caption or description for these photos and thought I could use <caption> or <figcaption>
It turns out that I would have to describe the figure or only use it once?? (not too sure) so I stuck to
doing my one line description in a paragraph form
