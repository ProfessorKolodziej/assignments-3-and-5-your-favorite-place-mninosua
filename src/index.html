		<h2 class="adjust-pseudo">TIPS: DON'T LET SPAIN TURN TO PAIN</h2>

		<ul class="tips">

			<li class="pseudo-dash"><span class="bold-red">Use Taxis for the Airport:</span> Taxi Drivers in the Madrid area have a flat fee
				of €30 to and from the airport. Ubers, Cabify, and Bolt might be more expensive otherwise.</li>

			<li class="pseudo-dash"><span class="bold-red">Brush up on essential Spanish phrases:</span> You’ll probably take a Taxi, speak to
				a barista, or need to ask for directions. While Madrid is a very international city, brushing up on your Spanish will
				only make you feel more prepared.</li>

			<li class="pseudo-dash"><span class="bold-red">Keep your friends close and your purse closer:</span> Crowded areas are a target
				spot for pickpockets. Beware of distractions and leaving your bags unattended. Use a bag that's hard to pry open.</li>

			<li class="pseudo-dash"><span class="bold-red">Read the Dress Code:</span> Some popular tourist clubs are notorious for denying
				entry to those not strictly following the dress code. Don’t cut your night short and stay informed about the club’s
				expectations.</li>

			<li><span class="bold-red">Not all ham is created equal:</span> Many places in tourist areas will try to
				upcharge you on their ham prices. While Madrid has a Jamon heavy culture, it’s worth knowing what the actual market value is
				for good quality ham. Also, don’t get scammed by getting Paella in Madrid. Paella is more prevalent
				in the coastal regions of Spain. Madrid is all about the Tortilla Española and Cocido Madrileño.</li>

			Madrid's nightlife exploded, with legendary discotecas like Joy Eslava and Kapital drawing revelers

I kept resubmitting on gradescope because I got error messages pertaining to this last section. I wanted to
simply put a one sentence caption or description for these photos and thought I could use <caption> or <figcaption>
It turns out that I would have to describe the figure or only use it once?? (not too sure) so I stuck to
doing my one line description in a paragraph form
